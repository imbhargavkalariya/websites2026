    { name: "Dental Implants", icon: "fa-solid fa-tooth", overview: "A permanent solution for missing teeth. Titanium implants are surgically placed in the jawbone, providing a foundation for natural-looking crowns. Unlike dentures, implants prevent bone loss and function exactly like real teeth.", benefits: ["Permanent tooth replacement", "Prevents jawbone deterioration", "Looks and feels natural", "No damage to adjacent teeth", "Lifetime durability with proper care"], procedure: ["Comprehensive consultation and 3D CBCT scan", "Digital treatment planning with guided surgery software", "Implant placement under local anesthesia or sedation", "Healing period of 3-6 months (osseointegration)", "Crown fabrication and fitting"], recovery: "Most patients return to normal activities within 2-3 days. Mild swelling and discomfort for 3-5 days is normal. Soft diet recommended for 1-2 weeks. Full healing and osseointegration takes 3-6 months.", faq: [{ q: "How long do dental implants last?", a: "With proper care, dental implants can last a lifetime. The crown may need replacement after 10-15 years due to normal wear, but the implant itself is permanent." }, { q: "Am I a candidate for dental implants?", a: "Most adults with good general health and adequate jawbone are candidates. Even if you've experienced bone loss, bone grafting can make implants possible. A consultation will determine your suitability." }] },
    { name: "All-on-4", icon: "fa-solid fa-teeth", overview: "A revolutionary full-arch restoration using just 4 implants per jaw. The strategic placement allows for immediate loading — meaning you walk out with a fixed set of teeth the same day. Ideal for patients with significant tooth loss or failing dentition.", benefits: ["Full arch restoration in 24 hours", "Only 4 implants needed", "No bone grafting usually required", "Fixed, non-removable teeth", "Significant cost savings vs individual implants"], procedure: ["3D imaging and treatment planning", "Sedation and implant placement (4 implants per arch)", "Immediate attachment of temporary fixed teeth", "Healing period of 3-6 months", "Final prosthesis fitting and adjustment"], recovery: "Same-day temporary teeth allow normal function immediately. Swelling and mild discomfort for 5-7 days. Soft diet for 6-8 weeks while implants integrate. Final restoration fitted after 3-6 months.", faq: [{ q: "How is All-on-4 different from individual implants?", a: "All-on-4 uses just 4 strategically placed implants to support an entire arch of teeth, rather than replacing each tooth individually. This reduces surgery time, cost, and healing while providing the same functional and aesthetic results." }, { q: "Can I really get teeth in one day?", a: "Yes. With All-on-4, temporary fixed teeth are attached the same day as surgery. You'll leave the clinic with a functional, natural-looking smile. These temporaries are replaced with your final prosthesis after healing." }] },
    { name: "All-on-6", icon: "fa-solid fa-teeth", overview: "Similar to All-on-4 but using 6 implants per arch for enhanced stability and load distribution. Recommended for patients with adequate bone density who want maximum support, particularly for the upper jaw or patients with stronger bite forces.", benefits: ["Enhanced stability and strength", "Better load distribution", "Ideal for upper arch restoration", "Supports more teeth naturally", "Higher long-term success in complex cases"], procedure: ["Comprehensive 3D assessment", "Treatment planning with 6-implant design", "Surgical placement under sedation", "Immediate temporary prosthesis", "Final prosthesis after 4-6 months"], recovery: "Similar to All-on-4 with same-day temporary teeth. Slightly longer initial recovery (5-7 days) due to additional implant sites. Final prosthesis fitted after 4-6 months of integration.", faq: [{ q: "All-on-4 vs All-on-6 — which is right for me?", a: "All-on-6 provides additional support and is recommended for patients with strong bite forces, adequate bone, or those wanting extra security. All-on-4 is often sufficient and more economical. Your specialist will recommend the best option based on your anatomy." }] },
    { name: "Full Mouth Rehabilitation", icon: "fa-solid fa-tooth", overview: "A comprehensive treatment addressing all teeth in both arches. Combines implants, crowns, bridges, and other procedures to restore full function, health, and aesthetics.

Typically requires multiple visits over 7-14 days. Phased approach allows for healing between stages. Full recovery within 3-6 months.", faq: [{ q: "How long does full mouth rehabilitation take?", a: "The timeline varies based on your specific needs. Most cases are completed in 7-14 days of treatment in Dubai, with final restorations fitted after a 3-6 month healing period. A personalized timeline will be provided during consultation." }] },

Some sensitivity to hot/cold for 1-2 weeks. Normal eating and activities resume immediately after placement.", faq: [{ q: "Are veneers reversible?", a: "Traditional veneers require minimal tooth preparation and are considered irreversible. However, we also offer no-prep veneers that don't require enamel removal. Your dentist will discuss the best option for your situation." }, { q: "How long do veneers last?", a: "High-quality porcelain veneers typically last 10-15+ years with proper care. Avoid excessive force (teeth grinding, biting hard objects) and maintain regular hygiene visits to maximize longevity." }] },
    { name: "Smile Makeover", icon: "fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles", overview: "A comprehensive aesthetic transformation combining multiple treatments — veneers, crowns, whitening, and gum contouring — to create your perfect smile. Every detail is digitally designed and previewed before treatment begins.", benefits: ["Fully customized to your face", "Digital preview before treatment", "Combines multiple procedures", "Dramatic aesthetic transformation", "Boosted confidence and self-esteem"], procedure: ["Comprehensive aesthetic assessment", "Digital smile design and preview", "Treatment sequencing", "Procedures performed (veneers, crowns, etc.)", "Final reveal and refinement"], recovery: "Depends on procedures included. Most patients resume normal activities within 2-3 days. Full aesthetic result visible once all procedures are complete.", faq: [{ q: "Can I see my new smile before treatment?", a: "Absolutely. We use digital smile design technology to create a preview of your new smile before any treatment begins. You can approve, modify, or request changes before we start." }] },

Mild sensitivity for 1-2 days. Normal eating resumes after bonding. Avoid very hard foods for 24 hours.", faq: [{ q: "What material is best for crowns?", a: "Zirconia offers the best combination of strength and aesthetics. It's highly durable, natural-looking, and biocompatible. For front teeth, we may recommend layered porcelain for maximum translucency." }] },
    { name: "Bridges", icon: "fa-solid fa-bridge", overview: "A fixed solution for replacing one or more missing teeth. Uses adjacent teeth as supports (abutments) with artificial teeth (pontics) in between. An excellent alternative when implants aren't suitable.", benefits: ["Replaces missing teeth", "Prevents teeth from shifting", "Restores chewing function", "Fixed (non-removable) solution", "More affordable than implants"], procedure: ["Assessment of adjacent teeth", "Preparation of abutment teeth", "Digital impression", "Custom bridge fabrication", "Fitting and cementation"], recovery: "Mild sensitivity for 1-2 weeks. Normal eating resumes after cementation. Adjustments may be needed during the first few weeks.", faq: [{ q: "How long do dental bridges last?", a: "With proper care, bridges typically last 10-15 years. Good oral hygiene and regular checkups are essential, as the supporting teeth must remain healthy for the bridge to function properly." }] },
    { name: "Professional Whitening", icon: "fa-solid fa-star", overview: "Professional-grade whitening that brightens your smile by up to 8 shades. Our in-clinic treatment uses advanced LED technology for immediate results in a single visit. Safe, effective, and enamel-friendly.", benefits: ["Up to 8 shades brighter", "Single 60-minute session", "Enamel-safe formula", "Long-lasting results", "Immediate visible improvement"], procedure: ["Cleaning and shade assessment", "Gum protection application", "Whitening gel application", "LED activation (3 cycles)", "Final shade evaluation and aftercare"], recovery: "No downtime. Avoid staining foods/drinks (coffee, red wine, berries) for 48 hours. Some sensitivity for 24-48 hours is normal.", faq: [{ q: "Is professional whitening safe?", a: "Yes. Our professional whitening is completely safe when performed under dental supervision. We use enamel-safe formulas and protect your gums during the procedure. It's significantly safer than over-the-counter alternatives." }] },
    { name: "Root Canal Treatment", icon: "fa-solid fa-tooth", overview: "A procedure to save a severely decayed or infected tooth.

Normal activities resume immediately. Avoid chewing on the treated side until the crown is placed.", faq: [{ q: "Is a root canal painful?", a: "Modern root canal treatment is virtually painless.

Soft diet recommended for 2-3 days. Full healing within 1-2 weeks. Maintenance visits every 3-4 months.", faq: [{ q: "Can gum disease affect my implants?", a: "Yes.

const FAQS = [
    { cat: "Treatment", q: "How long do dental implants last?", a: "With proper care and regular dental visits, dental implants can last a lifetime.

    { cat: "Treatment", q: "Am I a candidate for dental implants?", a: "Most adults in good general health with adequate jawbone density are candidates. Even if you've experienced bone loss, bone grafting can make implants possible. A consultation with 3D imaging will determine your specific suitability." },
    { cat: "Treatment", q: "What is the difference between All-on-4 and All-on-6?", a: "All-on-4 uses 4 implants per arch while All-on-6 uses 6.
